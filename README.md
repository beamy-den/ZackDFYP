**Final Year Project (FYP) Report**

Welcome to the repository for my Final Year Project (FYP) report. 

The primary objective of the project was to build a virtual cycling environment using open source components (Unity, SUMO, sensors, V2X comms) 
to learn more about vulnerable road user (VRU) behaviour. The secondary goal being to explore the use of haptic signals to deliver safety related warnings 
to VRUs if time allowed. Simulating human and traffic interactions in a virtual environment allows the human response to mixed traffic conditions to be assessed.
The work of the project succeeded in integrating multiple sections of the virtual environment, but efforts to synchronise these are ongoing. This project 
revolves around a few systems that you need to learn well to use effectively. Knowing how to work efficiently in Unity, SUMO and CityEngine as well as good 
knowledge of how to code in C# and the sensors used are vital. This was achieved in the current project.
